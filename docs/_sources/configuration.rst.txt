Configuration changes
======================

Usually, only changes to Orthanc are needed. Orthanc onfigurations files are in:
Configuration
=============

Ovena configurations are in :code:`/etc`. 


    /etc/ovena/orthanc/

- ``orthanc.json``: basic Orthanc configuration, such as DICOM AET, port, etc.
- ``users.json``: usernames and passwords for the WADO, Dicomweb and configuration interfaces.
- ``modalities.json``: this is where the DICOM "clients" need to reside for the traditional DIMSE protocol


Chainging IP Address or hostname
--------------------------------

This is a Debian distribution, and you can follow Debian procedures to change IP address and hostname.

The recommended use of ovena is to use two NICs or LANs, one for administration (ssh), the other for the orthanc services. When doing so, this requires to explicitly set the various services to listen to the correct IP address.

* Use :code:`hostnamectl set-hostname <newhostname>`
* Edit :code:`/etc/hosts`
* Edit :code:`/etc/ovena/docker-compose.yml` and change the :code:`ports` directives accordingly.
* Edit :code:`/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to set the `ListenAddress` with the new IP address.

Client and Orthanc configuration
--------------------------------

For DIMSE Query/Retrieve each client needs to be given access with its IP address. Currently, the only supported way to do so is to edit the orthanc JSON config file and reload the docker image. Future versions will have to support Orthanc's live configuration ability via API.
